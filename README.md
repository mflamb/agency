Philly Grid was conceived as an apartment search web application that could enable users to obtain detailed information about the neighborhood surrounding their prospective home.  In one week, our team learned to use the OpenLayers JavaScript library to work with five different APIs, and we built a multi-layered map interface.  Users can toggle each layer to view the boundaries of any neighborhood in Philly, along with the distributions of three resources relevant to apartment shoppers: affordable housing, housing counseling, and parks throughout the city.

Users can also click to select an individual element from any layer and view details from its API such as the name and full address of an organization.

In the first week of the project, we found that working with several APIs and using OpenLayers to manipulate and display their data based on user behavior was enough to keep us busy.  We have not had time to incorporate the apartment search capability yet, and we aim to integrate more APIs to offer users more detail about any neighborhood in the city.  We also look forward to being able to store a user's past search information with any notes they may want to take about possible homes, so that users can view this information quickly and conveniently as they weigh their options.

REQUIREMENTS:

Please be advised, in order to access all of the APIs for the map layers you will need to use Google Chrome with the CORS extension downloaded and turned on.  This is a temporary solution for a minimum viable product demo, and we look forward to being able to improve browser support as soon as possible.
